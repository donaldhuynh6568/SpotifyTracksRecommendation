#OVERVIEW

I love discovering new music through my network of fellow music lovers. It is a similar feeling when you are able to share your enjoyment of a track from your library with another user. In this project, I utilize a recommendation algorithm that gives me song recommendations from another user's playlist library on Spotify.

This repository walks you through everything I did to build the algorithm:

1. Created a data pipeline to construct a dataset of songs to use as song recommendations by using Spotify's API to gather the tracks from the first 50 playlists of another user.
2. Scraped my songs in my library to base the recommender on by using Spotify's API
3. Explored my song data to understand my music preference and history

Developed a classification algorithm with xx% accuracy to use to recommend songs
5. Saved recommended songs from the algorithm to a Spotify playlist within the my account
