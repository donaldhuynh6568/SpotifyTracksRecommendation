#OVERVIEW

I love discovering new music, whether it is from digging through Spotify playlists or getting recommendations from fellow music lover. I also love to share my music with listeners that I think would enjoy the song. In this project, I utilize a recommendation algorithm that gives me song recommendations from another user's playlist library on Spotify.

This repository walks you through everything I did to build the algorithm:

1. Create a data pipeline by using Spotify's API to scrape tracks from the playlists of my own library, another user's library, and under a Spotify genre.
2. Explore the track data from my library to find insights on my music preference and history
3. Develop a classification algorithm with xx% accuracy to recommend songs
4. Use Spotify's API to saved recommended songs from the algorithm to a Spotify playlist which is posted to my Spotify profile
