OVERVIEW

One hobby that I regularly enjoy is music discovery, whether it is digging through Spotify playlists or asking a friend about a song playing at a party. In this repository, I perform exploratory data analysis on my Spotify streaming data from November 2020 - November 2021. I also build a machine learning model that recommends songs from another user's playlists or from Spotify's library.

This repository walks through everything I did to build the model:

1. Create a data pipeline by using Spotify's API to scrape tracks from playlists, specifically from my own library, another user's library, and a genre of my choosing
2. Develop and test a classification algorithms with the best one having an F1 score of 91%
3. Use Spotify's API to populate the recommended songs into a Spotify playlist on my profile
4. I also explore my streaming data from November 2020 to November 2021 to find insights and trends on how I listen to music
