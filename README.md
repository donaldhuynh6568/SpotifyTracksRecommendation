OVERVIEW

One hobby that I regularly enjoy is music discovery, whether it is digging through Spotify playlists or asking a friend about a song playing at a party. In this repository, I perform exploratory data analysis on my Spotify streaming data from November 2020 - November 2021. I also build a recommendation model that looks through another Spotify user's playlists to produce song recommendations.

This repository walks through everything I did to build the model:

1. Create a data pipeline by using Spotify's API to scrape tracks from playlists, specifically from my own library, another user's library, and a genre of my choosing.
2. Develop a classification algorithm with xx% accuracy to recommend songs
3. Use Spotify's API to saved recommended songs from the algorithm to a Spotify playlist which is posted to my Spotify profile
