OVERVIEW

One hobby that I regularly enjoy is music discovery, whether it is digging through Spotify's endless amount of curated playlists or talking to a friend about a song playing at a party. In this repository, I perform exploratory data analysis on my Spotify streaming data in Tableau and a Jupyter notebook to uncover insights and trends on how I listen to music.

I also build a machine learning model that recommends songs from existing playlists on Spotify. This repository walks through everything I did to build the model:

1. Create a data pipeline by using Spotify's API to scrape tracks from playlists, specifically from my own library, another user's library, and/or a genre of my choosing
2. Develop and test a classification algorithms with the best one having an F1 score of 91%
3. Use Spotify's API to populate the recommended songs into a Spotify playlist on my profile
